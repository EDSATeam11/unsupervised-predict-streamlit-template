  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>For the recommendations made in this app we used two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>use similar users (collaborative based filtering)</li>
<li>use similar content (content based filtering)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is an overview of how they work.</p>
<p><strong>Content based</strong><br>
Here we made recommendations based on how similar the properties or features of a movie are to other movies. We used movies with similar themes (in the same genre) or have similar actors to predict what the user will like. If you make your movie selection based on actors you love the recommendations will reflect that, and if you select movies based on a genre you prefer on a specific day the recommendations will reflect that. This algorithm takes a lot more into consideration than just ratings from other users.</p>
