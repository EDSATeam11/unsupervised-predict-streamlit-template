<p>The algorithms we use here to recommend movies rely on movies other users have seen and rated, as well as similar movies that a user has seen. The following is an overview of how they work.</p>
<p><strong>Content based</strong><br>
Here we made recommendations based on how similar the properties or features of a movie are to other movies. We used movies with similar themes or have similar actors and or/directors to predict what the user will like.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative based</strong><br>
This algorithm is based on past interactions between users and the movies in the database. We make recommendations based on movies that those users gave a high rating.</p>
